# Transport Management System (OOP Project)

This Java project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts through a simulated University Transport Management System.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding (Polymorphism)
- Class Hierarchies
- Abstraction

## Structure
- `User.java` – Base class
- `Student.java`, `Lecturer.java`, `TransportOfficer.java` – Subclasses with overridden `requestTransport()` method
- `TransportDemo.java` – Main class showing polymorphic behavior

## How to Run
- Open in Apache NetBeans
- Run `TransportDemo.java`
